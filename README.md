## Data Analysis Project (Python)
Project Overview
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a structured dataset using Python. The objective is to clean the data, analyze key patterns, and extract meaningful insights through statistical analysis and visualizations to support data-driven decision making.

### Objectives

* Understand the structure and quality of the dataset

* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

* Analyze important features and trends

* Visualize insights using charts and graphs

* Derive conclusions that support business or strategic decisions

* Dataset

* The dataset contains multiple variables related to the domain under study

* Includes both numerical and categorical features

* Used for identifying patterns, trends, and relationships

(Dataset is loaded and handled directly within the notebook)

### Tools and Technologies Used

* Programming Language: Python

* Libraries:

* pandas – data manipulation

* numpy – numerical operations

* matplotlib and seaborn – data visualization

*  Environment: Google Colab

### Project Workflow

* Data Loading

* Imported the dataset using pandas

* Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values

* Removed duplicates

* Corrected data types

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Descriptive statistics

* Distribution analysis

* Correlation analysis

**Data Visualization**

1. Bar charts

2. Line graphs

3. Histograms

4. Heatmaps

**Insights and Observations**

* Identified key trends and patterns

* Highlighted important variables influencing outcomes

**Key Insights**

* Discovered meaningful relationships between variables

* Identified trends and outliers affecting overall performance

* Provided visual summaries to make insights easy to understand

(Insights are supported with visualizations inside the notebook)
